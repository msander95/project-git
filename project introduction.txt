My project suggestion is to make an application for tracking the money you should be making on each paycheque. this app will track hours you work calculate pay based off your wage, and then subtract the tax amount from your region or location. As someone who has personally had to deal with mployers not getting paycheques correct i think this can help a lot of people. thats why i win
